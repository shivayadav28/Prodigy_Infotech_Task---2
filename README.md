# Titanic Dataset Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Titanic Dataset Analysis", which focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights regarding passengers' survival rates.

# Overview
The notebook performs a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key findings. This project is suitable for beginners in data science and machine learning as it highlights basic to intermediate techniques for analyzing structured data.

# Features:
**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examining relationships between variables and survival outcomes.

**Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to showcase trends and distributions in the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful features for further analysis.

**Statistical Insights:** Gaining an understanding of survival factors (e.g., gender, age, passenger class).

**Dataset**
The analysis is based on the Titanic dataset, which contains the following key features:

**PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger.

**Survived:** Survival indicator (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

**Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

**Name**,

**Sex**, 

**Age:** Demographic information.

**SibSp**, 

**Parch:** Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard.

**Fare:** Ticket fare.

**Embarked:** Port of embarkation.

# Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

**pandas**

**numpy**

**matplotlib**

**seaborn**

# Key Sections

**Data Cleaning:**
Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).
Converting categorical features into numerical representations.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Survival rates by gender, age, and passenger class.
Correlations between features and survival.

# Insights from visualizations.

# Visualizations:
**Heatmaps.**

**Bar charts.**

**Histograms and density plots.**

# Conclusions:

**Output**
The notebook generates various insights and visualizations, including:

**Survival rates by demographic and ticket class.**

**Fare distributions and their impact on survival.**

**Correlation matrix to identify feature relationships.**
